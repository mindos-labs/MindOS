# 🧠 **MindOS — Learn Everything. Scientifically. Fast.**

### _The world’s first AI-powered Scientific Learning OS that helps anyone learn, remember, and master anything — forever._

MindOS transforms learning using **15 science-backed memory techniques**, **AI planning**, **personalized projects**, **gamified progress**, and a library of **neuroscience-based tools**.
Built for **students (junior → boards → JEE/NEET → college)** and **lifelong learners**.

---

# 🚀 **Why MindOS?**

Students forget **80%** of what they study.
Learning is not the problem — **retention is**.

MindOS fixes this using:

- Cognitive science
- AI automation
- Personalized study plans
- Tools inspired by **Anki**, **SuperMemo**, **Pomodoro**, **Feynman**, **Dual Coding**, and more

---

# 🏗 **Core Concept: Projects**

Everything in MindOS revolves around **Projects**.

A Project = what you want to learn.

Examples:

- “JEE Physics: Optics”
- “9th Grade Biology: Cell”
- “Semester Exam – DSA”
- “Music Theory Basics”
- “Learn Guitar Chords”

### Each Project has:

- **Personalized onboarding**
- **Goal tracking**
- **Time-based retention plan**
- **Completion percentage**
- **Daily tasks & scientific tools**
- **Gamified rewards**

---

# 🔥 **Project Onboarding (AI-Powered)**

MindOS asks personalized questions:

- What do you want to learn? (Project name)
- How long do you have?

  - 1 week / 1 month / semester

- Retention goal:

  - **Forever** (DSA, skills, music theory)
  - **Till exams**
  - **Short-term learning**

- Difficulty level
- Preferred learning style
- Current base understanding

AI then generates:

- A **study roadmap**
- Daily plan
- Micro-tasks
- Scientific tool sequence
- Spaced repetition schedule
- Mindmaps / mock tests / quizzes plan
