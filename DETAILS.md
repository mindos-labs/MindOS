# 🚀 **MindOS = A Personalized Scientific Learning OS**

“Learn **anything**, remember it **forever**, using **neuroscience-backed tools** — all combined into **one master OS**.”

---

# 🌟 **CORE STRUCTURE OF MINDOS**

## **1. Projects (the heart of MindOS)**

A **Project** represents what the user wants to master:

* “JEE Physics — Optics”
* “9th Grade Biology — Cell”
* “Semester Exam — DSA”
* “Music Theory Level 1”
* “Learn Guitar Chords”
* “Board Exam — Entire Syllabus”

Inside each project:

### **Onboarding questions**

MindOS asks:

1. **What do you want to learn? (Project name)**
2. **Time you have to master it**

   * 1 week / 1 month / semester / customized
3. **Retention Goal**

   * Learn for:

     * **Forever** (DSA, core subjects, music theory)
     * **Till exams** (boards, semester finals)
     * **Till midsem in 1 week** (fast track)
4. **Difficulty level**
5. **Preferred learning method**

   * Videos / Notes / Solving / Quizzes / Mixed

→ MindOS auto-generates a **Project Learning Plan** using all 15 techniques.

### **What the user sees:**

A visually beautiful **progress bar**:

* Plan created = +10%
* Complete quiz = +3%
* Make mindmap = +5%
* Spaced review done = +2%
* Upload handwritten notes = +3%
* Finish active recall challenge = +5%

This gamifies learning → addictive, rewarding, sticky.
